## Editor Config

The project uses [.editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) to define the coding
style of each file. We recommend that you install the Editor Config extension
for your preferred IDE. Consistency is key.

## JSHint

The project uses [.jshint](http://jshint.com/docs) to define the JavaScript
coding conventions. Most editors now have a JSHint add-on to provide on-save
or on-edit linting.
